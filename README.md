# ForensicsMaterial
A compilation of the information from the slides of the Forensics class given by the RMA.

The single file in this repository contains a database for [cherryTree](https://www.giuspen.net/cherrytree/), a note-taking app.
Feel free to contribute by making a pull request and I'll add your new content !
The database is in sql format for now, might change it to xml if it doens't work well with git.
